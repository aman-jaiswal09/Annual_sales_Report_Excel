It typically includes detailed data on total revenue, sales volume, and product or service categories. The report is broken down by months, quarters, or regions to highlight trends and compare performance across periods. Key metrics like year-over-year growth, customer segmentation, and top-performing products are often visualized using charts and graphs.
